After engaging in the specified activities, our team gained valuable insights into enhancing the security and forensic capabilities of our Python project. 
The implementation of a Git Hook helped in fortifying the project against potential security vulnerabilities. By configuring the Git Hook to run and report security weaknesses in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed, we established a good measure to identify and address security issues at an early stage of development. 
This automated security check not only saves time but also ensures a more resilient codebase.

The creation of the fuzz.py file was a crucial step towards creating the project's reliability. 
Fuzz testing, executed automatically through GitHub actions, allowed us to systematically find and uncover potential bugs within five selected Python methods. 
This approach not only aided in identifying vulnerabilities but also streamlined the bug-fixing process.

Incorporating forensics into the project by modifying five chosen Python methods enhanced our understanding of potential post-incident analysis. 
This modification allowed us to gather relevant forensic data during the execution of these methods. Integrating forensics into the development process ensured that we are better equipped to identify, analyze, and respond to incidents.

To show our execution with fuzzing, the file named "fuzz_errors" has been included with our project.
